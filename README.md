# chromium-for-stadia
This is a quick hack to get [Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/) running on unsupported AOSP devices like the [Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/quest/).

The `ChromiumForStadia.apk` was created using the following steps:

1. A stock version of Chromium for Android was built using the [official guide](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/android_build_instructions.md) @ d8ee3103df6690863af52dad05b4fafa9d11f8ee from 3/08/2021, version 89.0.4389.86.
1. The changes in `chromiumForStadia.diff` were made to the stock source. The core changes are:
   * Modifying `chrome/android/java/AndroidManifest.xml`. This allows the app to show up on [Android TV devices](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/start/start).
   * Modifying `FullscreenHtmlApiHandler.applyEnterFullscreenUIFlags`. This fakes `{navigationUI: "hide"}` and avoids https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=933436#c7.
   * Modifying `device/gamepad/gamepad_platform_data_fetcher_android.c` to mark any controller's `mapping` as `standard`. Without this, Stadia doesn't detect the controller.
   * Modifying `third_party/blink/renderer/core/dom/document_or_shadow_root.h` to perform the equivalent of `document.pointerLockElement = document.fullscreenElement`. This hack gets around the fact that the [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) doesn't work as Stadia expects on mobile devices.
   * Modifying `chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/ChromeTabbedActivity.java` to replace BACK button with SELECT. This fixes a bug where xbox controller SELECT button is read as a back button which exits stadia instead of being processed by the game. This is only because Oculus Quest runs an old version of android with this bug present.

With these changes, going to [stadia.google.com](https://stadia.google.com) in this app and enabling **Desktop Mode** will allow you to stream Stadia to the browser on Android devices. You can also use unsupported USB & Bluetooth controllers with the browser. You can test your gamepad at [html5gamepad.com/](https://html5gamepad.com/).

This app was tested on a Pixel 4 & Oculus Quest using an [ASUS Bluetooth Gamepad](https://www.asus.com/us/Home-Entertainment/Gamepad-TV500BG/), PS4 Dualshock, X-Box One controller, X-Box Elite 2 controller, and the official Stadia controller via USB C.

Note that this app is not officially supported by Google nor Oculus and may unexpectedly break at any point.
[This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/e11897/how_to_get_stadia_running_in_android_chrome_on/) has some more notes on how to get Stadia working in the browser without using a custom app. The app was just meant to streamline those instructions.
